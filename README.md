Overview of project:

The project aims to develop a no-code survey and data collection platform that empowers researchers, organizations, healthcare providers, and enterprises to design, distribute, and analyze surveys seamlessly. The system will leverage AI and ML for multi-language support, adaptive question flows, auto-coding of open-ended responses, and advanced analytics.

Problem Statement

Traditional survey tools are often limited to web or app-based responses, lack advanced AI-driven features, and require manual coding of open-ended answers. This makes large-scale, multilingual, and multi-channel data collection slow, expensive, and less effective.

Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a cloud-based survey platform with:

No-code survey builder for easy form creation.

Multi-channel delivery (Web, WhatsApp, calls, AI avatars).

Multi-language support (translation, speech-to-text, text-to-speech).

AI-powered personalization (adaptive questioning, recommendations).

OCR-based pre-fill from ID documents.

Paradata tracking (time taken, device, location).

AI auto-coding for open-ended responses.

Analytics dashboard for insights and reporting.

Target Users

Healthcare organizations → Collect patient feedback & health surveys.

Education sector → Conduct student/teacher assessments.

Social researchers/NGOs → Gather field data across multiple languages.

Businesses → Customer satisfaction & market research surveys.

Technology Stack

Backend: FastAPI (Python).

Frontend: Streamlit (dashboard), React (optional builder UI).

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB.

AI/ML Services: Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI Whisper, Google Translate API.

Multi-channel APIs: Twilio/Plivo (WhatsApp, calls), D-ID (AI avatars).

Deployment: Docker + Cloud (AWS/GCP).

Key Features

No-code survey builder (drag-and-drop UI).

Survey distribution across multiple channels (web, WhatsApp, calls).

Multilingual support for Indian and global languages.

Adaptive survey flow using AI logic.

OCR auto-fill for quicker responses.

Paradata tracking for behavioral insights.

AI-based coding of open-ended responses.

Interactive analytics dashboard with charts and exports.

Expected Outcomes

A scalable, AI-driven survey platform that reduces manual work.

Faster, more inclusive data collection (across languages & channels).

Improved data quality and insights through AI auto-coding and analytics.

A tool adaptable for healthcare, education, business, and social research.


Tools & Features Used in Firebase
1. Firebase Authentication (Auth)

Secure user authentication (email/password, Google sign-in, phone number).

Handles artisans, customers, and admins login/signup.

2. Firebase Firestore (NoSQL Database)

Stores artisan details, product catalog, survey data, and customer information.

Supports real-time updates (orders, responses, dashboards).

Flexible schema for multi-language product listings and survey responses.

3. Firebase Storage

Stores artisan images, product photos, videos, survey media (audio/video responses).

Provides secure download/upload URLs for client apps.

4. Firebase Hosting

Hosts the frontend web application (React/Next.js or Streamlit web version).

Provides global CDN for fast delivery.

5. Firebase Cloud Functions (Python Runtime)

Backend serverless functions for:

AI API calls (Vertex AI, Translation API).

Payment processing (Stripe/UPI).

Sending notifications.

Automating marketing content generation.

6. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Push notifications for:

Order updates (order placed, shipped, delivered).

Survey reminders for respondents.

Marketing suggestions for artisans.

7. Firebase Extensions

Prebuilt integrations like:

Payments (Stripe extension).

Email notifications.

Image resizing/compression for artisan uploads.

8. Firebase Analytics

Tracks user behavior, engagement, and retention.

Provides insights on:

Which products are popular.

Survey completion rates.

Artisan/customer activity.

9. Firebase Remote Config

Dynamically personalize UI (e.g., show different promotions to artisans/customers).

Rollout A/B testing for new features.

10. Firebase App Distribution / Crashlytics (for Mobile App)

For mobile version (Android/iOS) of your project.

Crash reporting, performance monitoring, and beta testing distribution.
